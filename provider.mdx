## SIP Trunking: Powering Seamless Global Connections

SIP trunking replaces traditional phone lines with a virtual connection over the internet, enabling your business to make and receive calls through a broadband connection. It links your internal phone system (PBX or VoIP) to a SIP provider, which then routes calls to the regular phone network. This setup makes your communication system simpler and usually more affordable.

## Supported SIP Providers: Bridging You to the World Beyond

We have the following providers available for initiating both inbound and outbound calls:

- **LiveKit** — Enables real time audio and video calls over the internet using virtual members.
- **Vapi** — Provides cloud telephony API for initiating and receiving phone calls programmatically.
- **Daily** — Powers multi-party voice and video communication with web-based integrations.
- **Twilio** — Offers global programmable voice to connect calls across any device.

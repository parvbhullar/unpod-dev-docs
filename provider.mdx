# Providers  
_Your link to the outside world._

## Overview  

**Providers** are the carriers and gateways that move your voice and messaging traffic outside Unpod.  
You can use **Unpod’s built-in SIP trunking** for simplicity or connect your own telecom partners for flexibility and cost control.  

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:  
1. Add a new provider connection  
2. Configure SIP settings and authentication  
3. Route calls through multiple providers

## Prerequisites  

- A verified **Unpod account**  
- At least one **phone number**  
- **Provider credentials** (SIP URI, username, password, or API key)  

---

## Add a New Provider  

1. In your **Unpod Dashboard**, go to **Providers** → **➕ Add Provider**.  
2. Select your provider type:  
   - **SIP** (e.g., Tata, Airtel, Twilio, Vonage)  
   - **Messaging API** (e.g., WhatsApp Business, Nexmo)  
3. Enter your credentials:  
   - **SIP URI or WebSocket URL**  
   - **Username / Password** (if applicable)  
   - **Region or Data Center**  
4. Click **Save** to register your provider.  

Your provider connection is now live.

## Connect Providers to Bridges  

To make your provider handle actual traffic:  

1. Open your **Bridge**.  
2. Go to **Provider Configuration**.  
3. Select one or more providers to attach.  
4. Save and publish.  

Your bridge will now route calls using the selected provider(s).

# BRIDGES  
Making sure every call finds its way home.

## Overview  
A **Voice Bridge** links your phone numbers and AI providers so calls can move smoothly through **Unpod**.

With it, you can:  
- Connect customers to your AI agents, PBX, or external systems.  

In this quickstart, you’ll:  
1. Create a Voice Bridge  
2. Attach a phone number  
3. Connect to a Voice AI provider  
4. Activate the bridge for live calls  

# Bridge Configuration

Bridges are the core routing components in the Unpod platform that connect different systems and services.

Voice Bridges enable businesses to:

- Provision regional phone numbers  
- Configure SIP trunks for inbound/outbound calls  
- Integrate with Voice AI infrastructure (LiveKit, Daily, Vapi, WebSocket, Unpod.AI)  
- Ensure regulatory compliance (KYC)  

This allows companies to manage calls at scale while staying compliant with Indian telecom regulations.

## Key Capabilities

### Provision Numbers
- Rent regional virtual numbers from Unpod  
- Add your own SIP trunk to start making and receiving calls  

### Voice AI Integration
- Connect to Voice AI providers such as LiveKit, Daily, Vapi, WebSocket, and Unpod.AI  
- Supports low latency and high reliability for AI-driven conversations  

### KYC Compliance
- Upload required documents  
- Complete KYC as per Indian telecom regulations to activate numbers

## How to Create a Voice Bridge in Unpod

A Voice Bridge connects your AI agent or PBX system with a phone number or SIP trunk, enabling calls to flow through Unpod.

### Steps to Create a Bridge

1. **Go to Voice Bridges**  
   - From the left menu, click on **Voice Bridges** (telephone icon)  
   - You’ll see a list of your existing bridges  

2. **Create a New Bridge**  
   - Click the ➕ button at the top-right of the Voice Bridges panel  
   - Enter a name for your bridge (e.g., *Sales Bridge* or *Support Line*)  

3. **Add a Description (Optional)**  
   - In the description box, note the purpose of the bridge (e.g., *For inbound customer support calls*)  

4. **Configure Telephony**  
   - Under **Telephony Configuration**, click **Select Available Number**  
   - Choose an Unpod virtual number  
   - The number will appear under **Selected Numbers**  
   - If it shows as *Not Linked*, click **Configure** to finish linking  

5. **Configure a Voice AI Provider**  
   - In the **Select Voice AI Providers** panel, scroll down to **Configure More**  
   - Pick the provider you want to connect (e.g., Vapi, Unpod.AI, LiveKit)  
   - Click **Configure** → a form will open asking for details like:  
     - API Key / Auth Token  
     - Endpoint / SIP URI / WebSocket URL  
     - Provider-specific settings (codecs, region, etc.)  
   - Enter the required details and save  
   - Once saved, the provider will now appear in your list of available providers  

6. **Select Your Provider**  
   - After configuring, go back to **Select Voice AI Providers**  
   - Choose your newly configured provider and click **Select**  
   - The provider is now linked to your Bridge  

7. **Integration & Documents (Optional)**  
   - Upload required documents under the **Documents** tab if needed for compliance  

8. **Publish the Bridge**  
   - Once your setup is done, click **Publish** (top-right corner)  
   - Your bridge is now active and ready to handle calls  

## Creating a Bridge

### Basic Bridge Configuration

```yaml
# bridge-config.yaml
name: "customer-support-bridge"
type: "direct"
enabled: true
provider: "twilio"
settings:
  account_sid: "${TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID}"
  auth_token: "${TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN}"
rules:
  - pattern: "^support"
    target: "support-agent-1"
  - pattern: "^sales"
    target: "sales-team"
```

### Bridge Types

1. **Direct Bridge**
   - Simple point-to-point connection
   - Minimal configuration required
   - Best for basic routing needs

2. **Multi-point Bridge**
   - Connects multiple endpoints
   - Supports complex routing rules
   - Ideal for team distribution

3. **Transform Bridge**
   - Modifies messages in transit
   - Supports custom transformations
   - Useful for protocol conversion

## Bridge Configuration Options

| Parameter    | Type     | Required | Description                          |
|--------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `name`       | string   | Yes      | Unique identifier for the bridge     |
| `type`       | enum     | Yes      | Type of bridge (direct, multi, transform) |
| `enabled`    | boolean  | No       | Whether the bridge is active         |
| `settings`   | object   | Yes      | Provider-specific settings           |
| `rules`      | array    | No       | Routing rules for the bridge         |

## Managing Bridges

### Creating a Bridge via API

```javascript
// Example: Create a new bridge
const response = await fetch('https://api.unpod.com/v1/bridges', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'customer-support',
    type: 'direct',
    provider: 'twilio',
    settings: {
      account_sid: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID',
      auth_token: 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN'
    }
  })
});
```

### Monitoring Bridge Health

```bash
# Check bridge status
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.unpod.com/v1/bridges/customer-support/health' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use kebab-case for bridge names
   - Include environment prefixes (e.g., `prod-`, `staging-`)
   
2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry logic for failed operations
   - Set up alerts for critical failures
   
3. **Security**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Regularly rotate API keys and tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failures**
   - Verify API credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Confirm provider service status

2. **Message Routing**
   - Review routing rules for conflicts
   - Check pattern matching logic
   - Verify target endpoints are reachable

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor message queue depth
   - Check system resource usage
   - Review rate limiting settings

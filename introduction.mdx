## Unpod AI: The AI Voice Your Business Can Trust

Unpod is a platform that acts as a building block for communication with four core components:

1. **Numbers**
2. **Providers**
3. **Bridges**
4. **Agents**

Start with a number, select a provider or channel, route traffic through a bridge, and optionally add a voice agent to automate or assist conversations.

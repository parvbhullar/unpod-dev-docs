## Unpod AI: The AI Voice Your Business Can Trust

Unpod is a platform that acts as a building block for communication with four core components:

1. **Numbers**
2. **Providers**
3. **Bridges**
4. **Agents**

Start with a number, select a provider or channel, route traffic through a bridge, and optionally add a voice agent to automate or assist conversations.

## How Unpod Works

With Unpod, you can set up three basic components:

| **SETUP SPACE** | **SETUP AGENT** | **SETUP TELEPHONY** |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| A dedicated space that helps to manage your emails, contacts, and documents. | A custom AI agent for all your needs like customer support and sales support. | Add number, link a voice infra provider, complete KYC, and start calling. |

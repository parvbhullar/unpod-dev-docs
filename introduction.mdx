## Welcome to Unpod

Unpod is a modern communication platform that helps developers build, scale, and manage voice and messaging applications with ease. Our API-first approach allows you to integrate powerful communication features into your applications in minutes.

It is a full-spectrum communication platform that lets you send messages, make and receive voice calls, and automate conversations - all over the internet. Rather than using traditional phone lines, everything happens via virtual numbers, telecom providers, bridges, and AI agents. It also connects with tools and channels you already use, like WhatsApp, email, CRMs, and ERPs.

## With Unpod’s SIP + Communications suite, you can:

- **Rent virtual phone numbers** for voice and SMS.
- **Connect your own or multiple telecom / SIP providers**.
- **Route calls and messages** flexibly through bridges. 
- **Add AI agents** that can understand context and respond automatically.
- **Integrate with external channels**: WhatsApp, email, and sync with your CRM/ERP systems for unified workflows.

Think of Unpod like **building blocks for communication**:  
Start with a number, select which provider or channel handles traffic, link them through a bridge, and optionally add an AI agent to automate or assist conversations.  

Unpod is flexible - you can run it simply (just number + provider), or leverage advanced flows and omni-channel communication where voice, SMS, WhatsApp, and email all come together, guided by AI.

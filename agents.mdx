Unpod Agents are AI-powered assistants that handle calls, chats, and tasks. With an agent, you can decide how it interacts with users, what knowledge it accesses, and how it communicates over the phone.

### Step 1: 
Login to the Unpod dashboard using your credentials.  
Click on **AI Studio** from the left sidebar of the dashboard as shown below.

## Model

A "model" refers to a customizable AI agent or system designed to perform specific tasks—such as managing conversations, automating support, or executing workflow actions.

In this section, you can define how your AI agent interacts with users—from the moment it initiates a conversation to the way it understands and resolves customer queries. You can also include the system prompt, which acts as the agent’s guiding framework—shaping its tone, behavior, and decision-making process throughout each interaction.

Essentially, this is where you outline your AI’s personality, purpose, and process—how it greets, assists, and delivers solutions seamlessly.

<img src="./images/AgentModel.png" alt="Agent Model" />

### Step 1 — Persona  
Enter the **Greeting Message** (how the agent starts a conversation) and **System Prompt** (defines agent behavior throughout the chat).

<img src="./images/AgentModelStep1.png" alt="Agent Model Step 1" />

### Step 2 — Objectives (Optional)  
If you want your AI to focus on specific questions or topics, define them here. You can add multiple objectives.

<img src="./images/AgentModelStep2.png" alt="Agent Model Step 2" />

### Step 3 — Knowledge Base (Optional)

If FAQs are too large to include in the System Prompt, create a Knowledge Base and link it to your Voice Agent.

#### How to Create a Knowledge Base?

1. On the dashboard, click on **Knowledge Base** from the left corner.

## Voice Profile

A voice profile is a collection of settings that determine how an AI or virtual assistant sounds during conversations. It defines attributes such as voice gender, accent, tone, speed, and emotional style—helping shape the overall personality of the assistant.

By customizing these elements, businesses can create a natural, consistent, and brand-aligned voice that enhances user engagement. Voice profiles make automated calls and chat interactions feel more human, relatable, and personalized for every listener.

### Step 1  
Click **Select** to choose a Voice Profile from the given options.

## Advanced

The **Advanced** feature allows you to automate outgoing calls using your Voice AI agent. Once configured, your AI can automatically call the provided number at a scheduled time—making outreach seamless and efficient.

### Step 1 – Auto Reachout Tab

The **“Auto Reachout”** tab includes the following parameters for setup:

- **Enable Follow-up:** Automatically schedules a follow-up call with the user when needed.  
- **Enable Callback:** Allows the assistant to initiate a callback if the previous call was missed or disconnected.  
- **Handover Number:** Specifies the number where calls will be transferred if a human handover is triggered.  
- **Calling Hours:** Defines the time window during which automatic calls can be made. You can set flexible scheduling rules based on your preferred time slots.

This feature ensures your AI agent manages outreach efficiently—following up, reconnecting, and handing over calls whenever required, without manual intervention.

### Step 2 – Stop Speaking Plan

The **“Stop Speaking Plan”** tab controls how your assistant manages interruptions during a call. It includes the following settings:

- **Number of Words:** The number of words a customer must speak before the assistant stops talking.  
- **Voice Seconds:** The time (in seconds) a customer can speak before the assistant pauses.  
- **Back Off Seconds:** The delay (in seconds) before the assistant resumes speaking after an interruption.

## Analysis

The **Analysis** tab helps you evaluate and understand the success of your call logs. It includes the following sections:


### Step 1 – Summary  
Use this to define the prompt for summarizing calls. The generated summary is stored in `calls.analysis.summary` and can also be viewed on the **Calls Log** page.

<img src="./images/AgentAnalysisStep1.png" alt="Agent Analysis Step 1" />

### Step 2 – Success Evaluation  
Assess whether a call was successful. You can use the **Rubric** alone or combine it with a **Success Evaluation Prompt**. If both are provided, they are merged into a single instruction set for accurate evaluation.

<img src="./images/AgentAnalysisStep2.png" alt="Agent Analysis Step 2" />

### Step 3 – Structured Data  
Extract structured data from call conversations. You can use a **Data Schema** alone or together with a **Structured Data Prompt**. When both are provided, they are combined into cohesive extraction instructions.

## Identity

Identity defines the AI agent's name, role, and persona that determine how it presents itself and interacts with users. The main sections of the Identity are:

- **Description** - A high-level description of the AI assistant - what it does, its domain (e.g., rolling mill machinery), and its primary purpose. This helps users quickly understand the assistant's focus and capabilities.
- **Privacy** - It means whether the agent is accessible to everyone or it remains private to only some people.
- **Classification** - Mention the keywords that help the users to discover your agent.
- **Purpose** - The purpose for which you have created the agent, Business, Personal, and Service.

## Integration

Webhook integration is the process of using webhooks to enable real-time communication between web applications, where one application sends data to another as an event occurs.

To enable the webhook integration, you have to click on Enable Webhook as Yes.

Webhook URL is the endpoint which will be provided by the user.

You can also add some headers while doing this integration if needed. Webhook headers are the key-value pairs for identification, authentication, and context, telling the receiver who sent it, how to process data, and event details.

**Security and Authentication Headers:**
- **Authorization** - For bearer tokens or basic auth (e.g., Bearer token).
- **X-Hub-Signature / X-Hub-Signature-256** - HMAC signature to verify the request authenticity (GitHub, etc.).
- **X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256** - The signature of Shopify to verify the delivery.
- **Idempotency-Key** - Ensures a request is processed only once, even with retries.

**Platform-Specific Headers (Examples):**
- **X-GitHub-Event** - Type of event (e.g., push, pull_request).
- **X-Shopify-Topic** - The event topic (e.g., products/create).

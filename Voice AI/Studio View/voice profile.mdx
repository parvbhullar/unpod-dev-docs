## Voice Profile

A voice profile is a set of settings that define how an AI or virtual assistant sounds during conversations. It includes choices like the voice's gender, accent, tone, speed, and emotion, allowing businesses to create a natural and consistent speaking style that matches their brand or use case. Voice profiles help make automated calls or chat interactions more engaging and personalized for users.

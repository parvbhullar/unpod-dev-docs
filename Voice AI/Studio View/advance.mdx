## Advanced

This is the advanced feature with the help of which you can set up automatic calls. When you set up this feature, your Voice AI agent will automatically call on the provided number at a given time.

### Context Settings
This setting enables the AI assistant to retain and reference relevant details from past conversations, allowing it to better understand user context over time. By using conversation memory, the assistant can deliver more personalized, consistent, and context-aware responses instead of treating each interaction as isolated.

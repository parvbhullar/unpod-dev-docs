As you can see two fields are mandatory Name and Contact Number which you can not delete from the schema, rest of the fields can be deleted from the schema as per the requirement of the business. There is a check box in front of each field, if the check box is ticked that means the field is compulsory to fill but if there is no tick that means the field is not compulsory to fill. You can also add new fields according to the business requirement by clicking on Add Field at the top right corner.

When you click on Add Field, you will get the options of which type of field you want to add like Text, Text Area, File, Date, Time, Date and Time, etc.

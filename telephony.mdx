## Bridges: Making Sure Every Call Finds Its Way Home

Bridges act as the central hub that controls and manages every call. They seamlessly connect phone numbers, service providers, and AI agents to ensure each conversation is routed correctly and runs smoothly.

With Bridges, you can define how calls flow, assign which service provider handles each number, and integrate with AI or traditional phone systems for smarter, more efficient call management. They also keep your essential documents organized and easily accessible for accurate record-keeping.

Think of Bridges as expert traffic controllers—directing every call to the right place at the right time.

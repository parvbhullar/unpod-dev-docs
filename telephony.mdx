## Bridges: Making Sure Every Call Finds Its Way Home

Bridges are known as central controllers that manage every call. They connect phone numbers, service providers, and AI agents to ensure each conversation is directed correctly and smoothly. Bridges help you set up how calls move, assign which service provider will handle each number, connect with AI or phone systems for smarter call handling, and keep all your important documents managed and organized for easy access and proper record-keeping. Think of them as the traffic police guiding all communication traffic efficiently.

### Steps to Create Bridges on Dashboard

## SIP Trunking: Powering Seamless Global Connections

SIP trunking replaces traditional phone lines with a virtual connection over the internet, enabling your business to make and receive calls through a broadband connection. It links your internal phone system (PBX or VoIP) to a SIP provider, which then routes calls to the regular phone network. This setup makes your communication system simpler and usually more affordable.

---

## Supported SIP Providers: Bridging You to the World Beyond

We have the following providers available for initiating both inbound and outbound calls:

- **LiveKit** — Enables real time audio and video calls over the internet using virtual members.
- **Vapi** — Provides cloud telephony API for initiating and receiving phone calls programmatically.
- **Daily** — Powers multi-party voice and video communication with web-based integrations.
- **Twilio** — Offers global programmable voice to connect calls across any device.

---

## Setup Process

As you have already selected the number, now you have to configure the number with the available provider. Currently Unpod is providing two options. Let's configure the number with both the providers step by step.

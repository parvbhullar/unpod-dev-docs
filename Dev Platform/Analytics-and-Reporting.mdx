## Getting Started

Analytics and Reporting refers to the tools and dashboards that track, measure, and visualize the activity and performance of a Space or AI agent. This includes metrics like user interactions, engagement, call outcomes, document usage, and overall agent effectiveness, helping teams make data-driven decisions and optimize workflows.

Unpod dashboard provides you with two options to see the reports and analyze the performance of your business. Both the options are available in Space View.

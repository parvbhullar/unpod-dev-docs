## Bridges: Making Sure Every Call Finds Its Way Home

Bridges are known as central controllers that manage every call. They connect phone numbers, service providers, and AI agents to ensure each conversation is directed correctly and smoothly. Bridges help you set up how calls move, assign which service provider will handle each number, connect with AI or phone systems for smarter call handling, and keep all your important documents managed and organized for easy access and proper record-keeping. Think of them as the traffic police guiding all communication traffic efficiently.

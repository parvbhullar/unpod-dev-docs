### Getting Started

Unpod is built with enterprise-grade security and compliance as foundational principles. Our zero-retention model ensures maximum data privacy while maintaining full functionality for your voice AI operations.

## Data Handling Matrix (ZERO Retention Model)

| Data Type | Retention | Storage | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Voice Audio (Raw) | 0 seconds | Memory only | Wiped on session end |
| Transcripts | 0 seconds | Memory only | Never written to disk |
| LLM Prompts/Responses | 0 seconds | GPU memory | No fine-tuning on customer data |
| Caller PII (phone, name) | 0 seconds | Never captured | Pass-through only |
| Anonymized Metrics | 90 days | Our systems | Latency, duration, errors only |
| Recordings/Transcripts | 90 days | Our systems | As per compliance requirements |
| Billing Records | 7 years | Our systems | Legal/tax compliance |

## Security Controls

- **In-Transit Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for all API calls, SRTP for voice streams
- **Memory Isolation**: Each session in isolated container with dedicated memory space; no cross-tenant leakage
- **Secure Wipe**: Memory overwritten with zeros on session termination; containers destroyed, not recycled
- **No Model Training**: Customer data never used for training or fine-tuning; contractually guaranteed

## Compliance Certifications

Built-in compliance with ISO-27001, and telecom regulations.

| Certification/Standard | Status |
|------------------------|---------|
| ISO/IEC 27001:2021 | Annual audit; report available under NDA |
| GDPR Article 17 | Compliant - Zero retention model inherently supports right to erasure |
| RBI Data Localization | India-only processing (Mumbai ap-south-1); no data leaves jurisdiction. Other than explicitly chosen models |

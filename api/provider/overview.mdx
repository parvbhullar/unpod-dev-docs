# Providers API

The Providers API allows you to manage telephony providers and their configurations in your Unpod platform. It covers both listing available telephony providers and full CRUD operations for provider configurations.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your API Token and Org-Handle ready. See [Authentication](/api/get-started/authentication) for details.

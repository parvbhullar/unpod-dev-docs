# Bridges API

The Bridges API allows you to manage telephony bridges for connecting call participants. Bridges handle call routing, conferencing, and telephony channel management in your Unpod platform.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your API Token, Org-Handle, and Product-ID ready. See [Authentication](/api/get-started/authentication) for details.

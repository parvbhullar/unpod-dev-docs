# Delete Bridge

Permanently delete a telephony bridge by its slug. Once deleted, the bridge and all associated configurations are removed. This action cannot be undone.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your API Token and Org-Handle ready. See [Authentication](/api/get-started/authentication) for details.
</Note>

<Warning>
Deleting a bridge that has active phone numbers or is actively routing calls will disrupt service. Disconnect all providers and reassign numbers before deleting.
</Warning>

<Note>
You can get the bridge `slug` by hitting the [Get All Bridges](/api/telephony/get-all-bridges) API. The `slug` field in the response is your Bridge Slug.

## Code Examples

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');

const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Token your-api-token',
  'Org-Handle': 'your-org-handle'
};

// Delete a bridge
const deleteBridge = async (slug) => {
  await axios.delete(
    `https://unpod.dev/api/v2/platform/telephony/bridges/${slug}/`,
    { headers }
  );
  console.log(`Bridge '${slug}' deleted successfully`);
};

// Example usage
deleteBridge('sales-bridge-001');
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Token your-api-token',
    'Org-Handle': 'your-org-handle'
}

def delete_bridge(slug: str):
    """Delete a telephony bridge"""
    url = f'https://unpod.dev/api/v2/platform/telephony/bridges/{slug}/'
    response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 204:
        print(f"Bridge '{slug}' deleted successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.json()}")

# Example usage
delete_bridge('sales-bridge-001')
```

```bash cURL
# Delete a bridge
curl -X DELETE "https://unpod.dev/api/v2/platform/telephony/bridges/sales-bridge-001/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token your-api-token" \
  -H "Org-Handle: your-org-handle"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Disconnect First**: Always [disconnect the provider from the bridge](/api/telephony/disconnect-provider-from-bridge) before deleting it
2. **Irreversible**: Deletion is permanent — verify the correct `slug` before proceeding
3. **204 Response**: A successful delete returns HTTP 204 with no body — handle this in your code
4. **Error Handling**: Handle 404 gracefully — the bridge may have already been deleted
5. **Pre-check**: Use [Get Bridge by Slug](/api/telephony/get-bridge-by-slug) to verify the bridge exists and check for active numbers before deletion
6. **Security**: Keep API tokens secure and rotate them regularly

# API Overview

Welcome to the Unpod API documentation. Our API provides programmatic access to Unpod's telephony and messaging services.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.unpod.dev/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using an API key. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting:
- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 10,000 requests per day per API key

## Response Format

All API responses are in JSON format and include standard HTTP status codes.

## Error Handling

Errors return a JSON object with an `error` field containing details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request was invalid.",
    "details": {
      "field": "phone_number",
      "reason": "invalid_format"
    }
  }
}
```

# Spaces API

The Spaces API allows you to manage and retrieve spaces (workspaces/groups) in your Unpod platform. Spaces are containers that organize your tasks, runs, and data collections.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your API Token and Org-Handle ready. See [Authentication](/api/get-started/authentication) for details.
</Note>

## What You Can Do

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v2/platform/spaces/` | Retrieve all spaces in your organization |
| `GET /api/v2/platform/spaces/{space_token}/` | Retrieve a specific space by its token |
| `GET /api/v2/platform/spaces/{space_token}/tasks/` | Retrieve all tasks within a specific space |

## Base URL

```
https://unpod.dev/api/v2/platform/
```

## Authentication

All Spaces API requests require a valid API token and Org-Handle in the headers:

```http
Authorization: Token your-api-token
Org-Handle: your-org-handle
```

<Note>
You can get the `Org-Handle` by hitting the [Get All Organizations](/api/space/organizations) API. The `domain_handle` field in the response is your Org-Handle.

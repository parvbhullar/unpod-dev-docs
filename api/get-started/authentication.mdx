## Overview

The Unpod SDK needs an access token to connect to the server successfully.

This token holds the participant's identity, room name, capabilities, and permissions.

Tokens are signed with your API secret to block forgery, and include an expiration time after which the server rejects them.

<Note>
Expiration time only impacts the initial connection, and not subsequent reconnects.
</Note>

## Authentication Method

The Unpod API uses **API Key Authentication**:

| Header        | Format          | Example                                        |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization | `Token <token>` | `Authorization: Token a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0...` |

## How to Get Your API Token

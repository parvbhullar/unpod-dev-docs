# Authentication

All API requests to Unpod must be authenticated using an API key. This document explains how to authenticate your requests.

## API Keys

### Obtaining an API Key

1. Log in to your Unpod account at [https://app.unpod.dev](https://app.unpod.dev)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New API Key**
4. Copy the generated key (it will only be shown once)

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```http
GET /v1/numbers HTTP/1.1
Host: api.unpod.dev
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token (Recommended)

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Query Parameter (Alternative)

```http
GET /v1/numbers?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Security Best Practices

- ðŸ”’ **Never expose your API key** in client-side code or public repositories
- ðŸ”‘ Use environment variables to store API keys

## Scopes and Permissions

API keys can be scoped to specific permissions:

- `write` - Read and write access
- `admin` - Full access (including account management)

## Rate Limiting

Authentication is subject to rate limiting:
- 100 requests per minute per IP address for unauthenticated requests
- 1,000 requests per minute per API key for authenticated requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing API key
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded

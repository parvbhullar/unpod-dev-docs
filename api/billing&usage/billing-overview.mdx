# Billing API

The Billing API lets you fetch invoices and payment status for your organization. It provides a paginated list of subscription invoices with their payment details.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your API Token and Org-Handle ready. See [Authentication](/api/get-started/authentication) for details.
</Note>

## What You Can Do

# Runs & Executions API

The Runs API allows you to manage and monitor execution runs in your Unpod platform. A **run** represents a batch execution — a group of tasks triggered together within a space.

<Note>
**Prerequisites:** Make sure you have your API Token. See [Authentication](/api/get-started/authentication) for details.
</Note>

## What You Can Do

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/v2/platform/spaces/{space_token}/runs/` | Retrieve all batch runs in a space |
| `GET /api/v2/platform/spaces/{space_token}/runs/{run_id}/tasks/` | Retrieve all tasks for a specific run |

## Run Lifecycle

```
Create Task (POST) → Run Created (pending) → Executing → completed / failed
```

## Base URL

```
https://unpod.dev/api/v2/platform/
```

## Authentication

All Runs API requests require a valid API token in the headers:

```http
Authorization: Token your-api-token
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Getting Started

Spaces are your personalized work hubs inside Unpod - organized, focused, and tailored so users can work smarter and collaborate better.

The interface below represents the Space View.

The left side bar of the Space View has four sections - Conversation, Calls, People, and Analytics.

At the left corner of the dashboard, you can see three dots from where you will be able to edit the space, copy the Space token, and download the Call Logs.

### Edit Space

When you click on Edit space, you will be able to edit basic information of the space, Table schema which is the predefined fields required while adding the contact, and also able to link the agent.

The main part to edit is Table Schema as the default schema has some fields which are not required or also we need some more fields according to the need of the business. When you click on Table Schema you will get the default fields.

<img src="./images/Space Mode1c.png" alt="Table Schema Screenshot" />

As you can see two fields are mandatory Name and Contact Number which you can not delete from the schema, rest of the fields can be deleted from the schema as per the requirement of the business. There is a check box in front of each field, if the check box is ticked that means the field is compulsory to fill but if there is no tick that means the field is not compulsory to fill. You can also add new fields according to the business requirement by clicking on Add Field at the top right corner.

When you click on Add Field, you will get the options of which type of field you want to add like Text, Text Area, File, Date, Time, Date and Time, etc.

### Space Token

Space Token is a unique access credential used to identify and authorize a user within a specific Space.

It is needed to secure access, control permissions, track activity, and ensure that actions (calls, docs, analytics) are correctly linked to the right Space and users.

### Call Logs

If you want to download all the details of the calls executed on the space in the form of CSV, you can download it from here.

## Calls

Call View is a dedicated interface where you can manage voice communication activities - including live calls, call history, transcripts, summaries, and call related actions - all within the context of that space. This section provides a centralized space to initiate voice calls directly from within the space, view ongoing voice sessions, and manage call settings.

In the call section, select the contact from the left side bar on which you have to make the call, then click on Call at the top right corner. You will be redirected to the page from where you can select the Voice agent and make the call.

Here, you have two options, first is directly click on Submit that will initiate the call immediately, second is the Schedule option from where you can schedule the call for later. When you click on Schedule, you will be redirected to the schedule page.

You have three options in the above scenario:

- **Now** - This is the default option
- **Auto Schedule** - This will take the pre-configured agent hours which we provide while creating the agent
- **Custom Schedule** - In this option, you can select the date and time manually

At the top right corner of the dashboard, you will be able to see the status of the call - outgoing/inbound or Pending/In Progress/Completed etc.

In the call section, you have two more tabs - Overview and Conversation.

### Overview

In the overview, you will be able to find the entire details:

- **Summary** - Details about what the agent is offering
- **Call recording** - Call recording of the entire conversation
- **Analytics** - In this section, all parameters and outcomes of the call are shown like what is the interest level of the customer, which agent is used, outcome of the call, cost of the call, who triggered the call, etc
- **Next Action** - If any action is required by the client to fulfill the requirements of the customer
- **Follow Up** - This will show whether we have to take the follow up from the customer or not. This is the case when we see a customer is interested in a product or service

### Conversation

In the conversation, chat between the customer and agent is visible. You may take the key points without listening to the whole recording.

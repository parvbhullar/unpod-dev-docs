## SIP Trunking: Powering Seamless Global Connections

**SIP trunking** replaces traditional phone lines with a **virtual connection over the internet**, enabling calls through broadband. It connects your internal phone system (PBX/VoIP) to a SIP provider, which routes calls to the regular networkâ€”making it **simpler and more cost-effective**.
